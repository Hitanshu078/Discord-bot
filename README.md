Track -> Discord Bot

Problem Statement: Create a discord bot on the theme: Arcade-Bot

Goal: The aim is to make a Complete Functioning Bot on the Theme of Pokemon that includes multiple games related to the Pokemon Universe.

#WELCOME TO THE POKEMON UNIVERSE!
Our Poki bot includes almost all the pokemon related games and mini-games you can think of on a fundamental level.

Imagine being a Trainer and owning Pokemons! This is possible in our poki bot.
--> Build your multipurpose inventory that contains Almost all pokemons, berries, potions, pokeballs and other utility-items.
--> Buy Pokemons and the Utility items from the marketplace
--> Sell Pokemons and the Utility items from the marketplace
--> The more you interact, the more your experience level increase

--> The famous "Who's that Pokemon" game where you can test your knowledge about the pokemons (includes all generations)
--> Think you are the Master of the Pokemon's universe? You can play Trivia where The Bot can ask you literally anything related to the pokemon universe.

--> Challenge other discord members as you can battle with them using the pokemons in a 1v1 game

--> Card Collection game! Yes!
Not only You can collect pokemons and utility items, we have a separate inventory for you where you can collect cards related to pokemons. You probably would like to test your luck for the legendary card drops.
--> You can even trade the cards with other members in the discord (Note: the complete syntax for trade command is $trade @username <pokemon_name>

--> (Bonus) -> We have astory mode too where we have tried to create a story mode game inspired from Pokemon: Power of Us Movie

#Deployment: 
We have chosen Repl.it for deploying the bot and hosting it.

#Applications:
Main focus is to create a fun Pokemon related bot for the pokemon fans which includes almost everything from the Pokemon Universe.

#Further Imrpovements:
We have a lot of plans regarding this project.

Since We have Made this bot in only 4-5 days, a lot of features that we have tried implementing are on base levels.
We will be shifting to mongoDB for the database storage, and logging to Track real time changes in the battle.
We will be Introducing Guild systems and options for trainer character customisation.
Going ahead, we will be adding the moderations and other mini-games which we planned but due to time constraints, it wasnt possible at this point of time.
